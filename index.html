      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

The Guttmacher Institute is a research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights. They maintain a variety of global data related to global reproductive rights.

					Kansas leads the nation in abortions for out of state residents. This chart captures the ratio of abortions by the state of occurence divided by the abortions by state of residence in 2020. This means that if the number of abortions for state of occurence is greater than that for the state of residence, this state is conducting a larger number of abortions for out of state residents. 
				</figcaption>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Design Decision 1: I chose to transform the data and plot the sum of the number of abortions by state of occurence divided by the sum of the number of abortions by state of residence.

					<br>
					<br>

					Score: 1

					<br>
					<br>
					Design Rationale: Initially, when analyzing metrics like the total number of abortions or different levels, it was clear that California had the highest abortion numbers by a significant margin compared to other states. In graphics, California often dominated the view, overshadowing insights about other states due to its sheer volume in population and number of abortions.

					Therefore, I knew that I wanted to transform the data to draw more meaningful insights. 
					Looking at the available metrics, I thought it would be important to look into which states were conducting the most abortions for out of state residents, since I see this as a metric indicating support towards abortion.
					What worked well for this metric was that Kansas distinctly stood out and had twice as many out of state abortions for out of state residents compared to the average number. 
					The District of Columbia is the only state that even comes close to this number, with all other states much closer to the average or significantly below.
					This makes the statement even more persuasive because Kansas stands out for its support in helping with out of state abortions compared to other states.
					I originally considered the alternate of switching the two parts of the fraction to divide the sum of the number of abortions by state of residence by the sum of the number of abortions by state of occurence.
					This would highlight states, like Missouri and Wyoming, that cause residents to travel for abortions.
					The reason I did not choose this measure was because this would mean either I must find evidence suggesting that Missouri and Wyoming are supportive of abortion for my countervisual, or I would be highlighting the states with the least values.
					In general, as a viewer, I tend to be drawn to larger bars in charts. To emphasize Kansas's significant role, I chose the transformation that best allowed it to stand out.

				</li>
				<li>
					Design Decision 2: I chose to include an "average" line which represented the average ratio of abortions from out of state vs in state residents

					<br>
					<br>

					Score: 1.5

					<br>
					<br>
					Design Rationale: I wanted to include a metric that would allow viewers to easily compare Kansas's data.
					It is clear from the ordering of the bar graph that Kansas has the highest ratio of out of state residents who come to get an abortion, but the extent to which this is true is difficult to gauge without a comparison metric.
					Initially, I added an average line, but it didn't stand out as much as I hoped. I then changed its color to red, but that felt too bright and drew attention away from the key point I wanted to highlight.
					After trying a few combinations, I settled on a greyish line with light gray shading under the line to indicate that all states that fell under the line were below average and all states above the line were above average.
					This highlighted the extent to which Kansas conducted out of state abortions, as the bar for Kansas was almost twice the height of the average line. I think this overall worked well because it showed increased support for the proposition that Kansas supports abortion
				</li>
				<li>
					Design Decision 3: I chose to display the data as an ordered bar chart

					<br>
					<br>

					Score: 1

					<br>
					<br>
					Design Rationale: When I first visualized this data, I used a map format, which worked well in showing that Kansas had a high proportion of out-of-state abortions. 
					It also highlighted that Missouri had a relatively low number, suggesting that many Missouri residents likely traveled to Kansas for abortions since they are neighboring states.
					This is an insight that is somewhat lost in the current visualization.
					While interesting, I felt it wasn't the most crucial takeaway for this chart, and other visualizations might better support the key points I wanted to communicate about Kansas specifically.
					The map visualization, though effective in some ways, made it harder to quantify how much Kansas stood out compared to other states. 
					In contrast, the current bar chart makes it much easier to visually grasp the extent to which Kansas surpasses other states, which is why I opted for this version.
					I also considered using a scatterplot, but like with the maps chart, I felt that simply placing a point on the mark wouldn't effectively convey the significant difference in out-of-state abortions. 
					In contrast, a bar chart clearly shows this disparity, as the bar extends all the way to the top, visually demonstrating that the area occupied by out-of-state abortions is nearly double that of other states.
				</li>

				<li>
					Design Decision 4: I chose to label the bar for Kansas with a quantitative comparison metric

					<br>
					<br>

					Score: 0.5

					<br>
					<br>
					Design Rationale: 
					While I meant to use the visualization styles and techniques already mentioned above to highlight and quantify Kansas's impact, I also wanted to include this information in words and label the bar chart to draw the viewers eyes to this important piece of informaiton.
					Otherwise, if the viewers did not read the title and only looked at the graph, they might be confused as to whether I am trying to highlight that Kansas out of state abortion rate is high or Missouri low. 
					Ideally, I would have also changed the color of Kansas's bar to further draw attention to the state. However, I was uncertain whether this might be too overwhelming and potentially raise questions about the chart's reliability.
					Instead, I chose label the bar and highlight the box around this label in red since red as a color stands out and the rest of the visualization uses cool tones. 
					This overall worked well because the graph now not only visually quantifies the value, but also explicitly quantifies it, which supports the main proposition that Kansas supports abortions.

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

					Source: Abortion Data by U.S. State from the Guttmacher Institute. The Guttmacher Institute is a research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights. They maintain a variety of global data related to global reproductive rights. This data set contains data about abortion rates, abortion providers, and abortion seekers, aggregated to the state level.
					
					<br>

					<br>

					States near the midwest of the US provide the least support towards abortion. This chart captures the number of publicly funded abortions in 2010. We plot the values on an inverse scale to highlight the states which provide the least support. 

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Design Decision 1: I decided to transform the data by summing the total number of publicly funded abortions in the state and then taking the inverse of that value plus one. 

					<br>
					<br>

					Score: -1.5

					<br>
					<br>
					Design Rationale: Initially, I simply summed the total number of publicly funded abortions in each state and plotted the results. 
					However, I quickly realized that California stood out dramatically with 88,466 public abortions, while the second-highest state, New York, had almost half that number at 45,722. 
					After New York, the rest of the states had significantly lower figures, often only in the thousands or even fewer.
					As a result, in the original visualization, California and New York appeared overwhelmingly blue, while every other state was barely visible in a pale green. 
					Upon further analysis, I also noticed that several states—especially in the Midwest—reported funding zero abortions. 
					The gap between zero and 90,000 is huge, and I wanted a metric that could make these figures more comparable.
					I considered using a logarithmic transformation, which worked well for scaling large numbers to be on par with smaller ones. 
					However, it didn't effectively distinguish between smaller values. 
					For example, I felt there was a significant difference between funding 3 abortions versus none, but the difference between 80,000 and 80,003 seemed negligible, and this nuance wasn't captured in the logarithmic scale.
					I instead tried an inverse transformation, adding one to the sum to avoid undefined values when the number of abortions was zero.
					This approach produced the chart above, which I believe worked well in highlighting the Midwest as an area with fewer publicly funded abortions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Design Decision 2: I labeled the axis for coloring in a way that might be somewhat deceptive but was more understandable then explaining the actual metric.

					<br>
					<br>

					Score: -1.75

					<br>
					<br>
					Design Rationale: The metric for the inverse of publicly funded abortions may be difficult for the average viewer to understand. 
					To simplify this, I labeled the scale from 0 to the highest value, which was around 90,000 (California). 
					Readers are generally used to seeing 0 on the left and larger values on the right, so I adjusted the scale to align with this convention. 
					I placed the darker color on the left and the lighter color on the right, even though, in the actual inverse scale, the values closer to 0 are larger, and those farther from 0 are much smaller.					This is because the darker blue stands out more than the lighter green, and since the main point is about the midwest states not publicly funding abortions, I wanted to highlight this.
					While the numbers on the scale don't directly represent the actual figures, I included the actual transformation in the description beneath the visualization for those who are more scientifically inclined.
					Overall, this approach effectively highlighted the states with zero cases, but it could be misleading at first glance. A more intuitive labeling of the metric might have made the data more immediately interpretable for viewers.
				</li>
				<li>
					Design Decision 3: I labeled the number of abortions funded by Kansas and the number of abortions funded by California to draw attention to these two states.

					<br>
					<br>

					Score: -2

					<br>
					<br>
					Design Rationale: Since the proposition I am trying to disprove is that Kansas supports abortion, I highlighted Kansas as the state with 0 abortions. 
					Without this distinction, Kansas could easily blend in with the other states, making it difficult for viewers to remember which state it is. 
					To provide contrast, I chose California, the state with the highest number of publicly funded abortions.
					While this choice is somewhat misleading, given that California's numbers are extreme compared to other states, it effectively highlights the contrast between Kansas and California. 
					What worked well was emphasizing these two states and explicitly quantifying their values, allowing for a more meaningful comparison at the state level rather than a broader, less detailed one.
					Additionally, surrounding the outside of the box with a red border helped it stand out in contrast to the cooler blue tones used for shading.
					However, to make the graphic less misleading, it would have been better to include other states alongside California, rather than just relying on the extremes. 
					For example, Alabama had only 9 publicly funded abortions, but it was shaded similarly to California, which may cause confusion.
					Ultimately, I chose this approach to emphasize the quantitative difference between Kansas and other Midwest states, and I felt that California, with its exaggerated numbers, best highlighted this contrast.
				</li>

				<li>
					Design Decision 4: I choose to display the data in a map format.

					<br>
					<br>

					Score: 1.5

					<br>
					<br>
					Design Rationale: I noticed that many states had 0 publicly funded abortions. 
					Upon examining these states, I found that a significant number were located in the Midwest and South. 
					While I could have highlighted individual states using a bar chart, similar to my first visualization, that approach would have lost the context of how these states are clustered together.
					Although this information isn't central to the argument that Kansas does not support publicly funded abortions, it strengthens the claim by showing that Kansas is situated in a region where publicly funded abortions are largely absent. 
					Moreover, using a bar chart would result in all these states being tied with a 0 value, meaning no bars would appear. 
					This would make it difficult for viewers to grasp the intended message, as our attention is naturally drawn to larger, more prominent bars, and without bars, the data would be less impactful.
					Additionally, the inverted scale wouldn't work with a bar chart, as it would imply that states with the fewest abortions should have the largest bars, which would be confusing.
					Ultimately, I chose to use a map format for this graphic because it effectively shows that Kansas is similar to neighboring states like Missouri, which also seem the least supportive of abortion in their regions. 
					The map highlights Kansas more effectively than a bar chart could, particularly since a bar for zero would be nonexistent in that format.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p> Reflecting on the overall design process across both visualizations, the challenge was in striking a balance between highlighting the key message while maintaining clarity and accuracy. 
		  The process was somewhat straightforward when deciding on metrics, like the number of out-of-state abortions or the inverse transformation of publicly funded abortions, as they supported the argument I wanted to convey. 
		  However, translating this data into a compelling visual that would communicate these insights to viewers was somewhat difficult. 
		  I was surprised by how important small adjustments—like changing color schemes, adding labels, or switching between formats—were in improving the viewer's understanding. 
		  For example, switching from a map format to a bar chart made it easier for viewers to grasp the quantitative difference between states, and choosing a simple labeling strategy helped draw attention to Kansas without overwhelming the viewer.
		  Additionally, it was difficult to accurate communicate translated metrics in a way which was easy for the viewer to interpret upon first glance.
		  What surprised me was how easily the data could be manipulated, and how many opportunities there were throughout the process to shape its presentation. 
		  For instance, the data can be influenced through transformations, axis representation, scaling, and even by selectively highlighting certain points to emphasize a particular message. 
		  This assignment made me realize the importance of examining data holistically, rather than focusing solely on the information that the visualization is trying to highlight or communicate.
		  <br>
		  <br>

		  My definition of "ethical analysis and visualization" emphasizes transparency and visual choices which make the design choices clear without trying to mislead viewers. 
		  This means that "acceptable" persuasive choices should prioritize clear communication of what the data is actually saying, while "misleading" choices would manipulate or distort the data to communicate their intended message. 
		  For instance, when I used a transformation to better highlight Kansas's role in out-of-state abortions, this is considered acceptable because it emphasizes the data's key point without misrepresenting it. 
		  On the other hand, presenting California as a comparison and having it the same color as Alabama, or mislabeling the exact measurement/translation, would be considered more misleading. 
		  One hard boundary I would draw would be that the axis must actually state what the data represents, not something which is similar to what the data represents. 
		  Another boundary I would draw would be to avoid using outliers as example comparisons unless the outlier is the what you are trying to make a point about (this would mean using a state other than California as a comparison).
		  The boundary between persuasive and misleading is nuanced, but it ultimately lies in how faithfully the visual maintains the integrity of the data while effectively communicating the intended message.
