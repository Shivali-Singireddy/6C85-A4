					Kansas leads the nation in abortions for out of state residents. This chart captures the ratio of abortions by the state of occurence divided by the abortions by state of residence. This means that if the number of abortions for state of occurence is greater than that for the state of residence, this state is conducting a larger number of abortions for out of state residents.
